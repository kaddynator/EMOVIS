# EMOVIS

This repository contains the codes and instructions files for the EMOVIS tool. 

The file project.Rproj is the project file that needs to be loaded to the R studio platform. Once we load this project file to the R studio, we got all the codes of the project inside the R studio cloud.

The files inside the folder "Emotion" contain the codes for the visualization tool.
